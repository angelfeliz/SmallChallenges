# Camper Leader Board
### challenge
*https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard*

In this challenge I work with **Reactjs**, what I have to do was talk with the *FreeCodeCamp API* and get all the campers with highest score in the las 30 days and all time. Create a page with react where can sort and change between the highest score on the last 30 days campers or all time campers.
